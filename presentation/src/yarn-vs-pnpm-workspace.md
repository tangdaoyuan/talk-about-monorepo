# Yarn workspace and Pnpm workspace

<div v-click-hide>

In Yarn official docs

Yarn workspace compare to Lerna

> Yarnâ€™s workspaces are the low-level primitives that tools like Lerna can (and do!) use. They will never try to support the high-level feature that Lerna offers, but by implementing the core logic of the resolution and linking steps inside Yarn itself we hope to enable new usages and improve performance.

<!-- From other way, yarn and yarn workspace have do lost of works that Lerna does  -->


In Pnpm official docs:

> pnpm has built-in support for monorepositories (AKA multi-package repositories, multi-project repositories, or monolithic repositories). You can create a workspace to unite multiple projects inside a single repository.

<!-- Pnpm say: my workspaces == monorepo -->
