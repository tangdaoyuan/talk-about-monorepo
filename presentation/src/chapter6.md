# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes are able to provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true">

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-seriph/01.png?raw=true">

</div>
